  //3. It sets a Timeout to terminate this process by clearing the interval, and checking if the new player's position is a snake or ladder. (by calling the 'applySnakeOrLadder' function)
  //4. Then updates the player's position and changes the turn.
  //5. If the player is not allowed so far to start the game, first, it checks if they just got a 6, and then update the player's permission; and then it changes the turn anyway.
